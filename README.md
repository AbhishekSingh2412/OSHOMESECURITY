# OSHOMESECURITY
Created for a hack, specific to problem statement. Using a raspi to power LED's using Pyrebase+Google Speech Recognition+Pyaudio

In  my case, I used VSCode to run main.py and processing.py files
The Raspberry Pi is used to run raspi.py
The raspi is used to obtain values from firebase and triggere the led's on the breadboard
A relay maybe used as well instead of led's
